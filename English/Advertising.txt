===== Analyzing ads =====

Nespresso:
Target market: business people with good income, upper middle class, well dressed,

Target: young, trendy people, smart people
Tricks and tools: comparison with windows, funny, 

Johnny Walker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSIp76CvUI
Target market: men, middle age/class, with a taste for good products
Tricks: length (it's a shortfilm), how the ad is made (in one take), charisma, the true story about this whiskey

Pros/Cons of advertising media:

	* Con: You don't really know who is listening, difficult to make a good ad, 
* TV:
	* Pro: huge audience, flexible
	* Con: You don't really know who is watching, targeting is difficult, not much time
* Newspaper:
	* Pro: localized audience, targetting market is possible, deliver "trust", cheap (in comparison with Radio/TV), 
	* Con: not much space, sometime only b/w print, easy change
