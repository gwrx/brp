===== Presentation =====

3.4-2: Analyzing a presentation

What can he do better:
* he stutters
* technical words are not explained
* he forgets things and details
* no structure
* he's repeating himself

Version 2:
* he opens with rethorical questions
* the investment for production
* 15 minutes, demonstrations
* he allows questions after the presentation, or urgent questions can fall in
* background of project, prototype, business plan

==== Structure ====

1. Introduction: Hook (e.g. rhetorical questions, humor), objective, agenda/outline
2. Main Body: signpost
3. Conclusion: summary, (call for action), closing (thankyou/questions)

=== Presentations ===
Flexible tablet: Flexablet 9000

Hook: broken displays, too small or too big tables, low battery capacity
Objective: let them advertise and sell the flexablet 9000
Outline: the specs, features, packaging

Product specs: 1mm thickness, default size is 20x30 cm (but you can cut it to your preference and make two of them), transparent like a film, no buttons (all touch), material is a secret (self developed)
Feature 1:
it is flexible: like a sheet of paper (roll it, fold it, slap it, throw it), all touch (on both sides), waterproof, unbreakable. All electronics are embedded inside the film; if you got a fold it it, ironing does the job;
Packaging: it's rolled up in a bottle (flaschen-post)
Feature 2:it is transparent: shine through it with a lightbulp and you have a projector; you can even utilize the old, dusty overhead projector; or use it as augmented-reality-device and look trough i

Summary:
Call for action: invest at least a billion into marketing to be allowed to sell it
Closing: hands-on demo with you being able to try to destroy the flexablet 9000


Target market: upper class with enough money to buy it
Ad channels: TV & Billboards (billboards are made of huge flexablet - so....)
