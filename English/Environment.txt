==== Film ====
"The Age of Stupid"

* foods
* expanding deserts
* no more glaciers
* no arctic ice

causes:
the run for cheap resources (such as oil)
it's all about the money, power
political influence / corruption
energy consumption
climate change
overconsumption
transport & travel
abuse of developing countries

effects:
floods, famine, illnesses, heatwaves, poverty, global warming, death, war, pollution, 
natural disasters, sea temp. rises (effects the marine life), melting of the polar caps & glaciers, golf stream slows down
deserts expand, more droughts, loss of animal habitat â†’ extinction, plants dry out and die, more poverty, less soil quality, more illness / disease

solutions
wind energy, solar energy, political change
renewable energy, recycle, recycled products, carbon off-setting

Definition of "Global Warming"
Man-made effect of using fossil fuels, polluting the atmosphere with it causing a warm up of seawater and atmosphere.

Greenhouse Gases
Gases like CO2, methane

"Greenhouse effect"
Gases like CO2 or methane that cause the heat reflecting ability of the atmosphere to drop.

Effects
* melting of ice-caps
* floods
* forest fires
* animal attacks
* spread of disease
* intensity / occurance of natural disasters & storms
* loss of bio-diversity / animal extinction
* less food & water supply

How to reduce energy consumption

Residential:
* grow your own vegetables
* support local farmers
* reduce waste & foodwaste
* better insulation
* natural lighting
* reduce heating
* reduce water consumption
* catch or collect your own food (hunter / farmer)

Commercial
* sustainbale energy
* recyclable packaging / reduce packaging
* LED lights
* solar heating
* car sharing
* public transportation
* good insulation
* digital advertising
* small offices
* photovoltaic energy

Industrial
* use new machines (energy efficient)
* produce locally / near resource source
* insulate the building
* build at the right place
* energy saving bulbs
* natural light
* use electric vehicles / trains
* local production
* use public transport / car sharing
* go by foot / bicycle

Transportation
* renewable energy
* low emission 
* transport on railways
* car sharing
* public transport
* efficient packaging
* road train
* working from home
* short work distances
* work locally
* shop locally
* efficient transport routes

* lighting e.g. housing
* transport
* festivals

==== 6. Issues ====
Acid rain: What is it? Causes?
Resource Exploitation: 
* Overfishing
* deforestation
* abuse of rainforests
* raw materials
* food
* rare materials

* overconsumption

Rainforest:
* causes?
* effects?
* solutions?

Water Usage:
* Saving Water?
	* use rain water / grey water
	* lower shower time
	* shower instead of bath
	* water saving shower head
	* fully load dishwasher/washing machine
	* reduce water flow
	* use a bucket when washing car
	* half-flush button on toilet

==== Ozone layer ====
* what is it?
* why is it important?
* How are we destroying it?
	* CFCs
		* fridges / freezers
		* aerosols
		* air conditioners
* Solutions?

==== Waste ====

===== Practise Exam =====
The Situtation: You are an environmental expert an you have been asked to give a speech to the UN members (= examiners) on the environment & pollution
Part 1: In your speech, outline
* The 5 types of pollution
* Their causes
* The effects of pollution

* Welcome
	* My name is / I am a
	* Today we are talking about
		* types of pollution
		* their causes
		* their effects
	* let's dive into it
* 5 types of pollution
	* Air pollution
		* transportation (airplanes, cars)
		* industry (production, power plants)
	* water
		* chemicals (spoiling oil rigs)
		* aluminium (breaking waste barriers)
	* soil
		* agriculture (chemical fertilizers)
		* tourism (skiing)
	* noise
		* highways/trains (a lot of it)
		* production plants (they can be loud too)
	* light
		* billboards (too much in cities)
		* stadiums (only that bright for TV)
* the effects
	* health is affected
	* global warming
* what to do about it
	* we need long-term solutions
		* invest in ad-campaigns agains overconsumption
		* invest in research and development
		* invest in renewable energy
