===== Glass Ceiling =====
Reading Comprehension

* What does the term "Glass Ceiling" mean (in your own words)
The Problem for women or minorities to climb the corporate ladder in companies.

* How has the definition changed over the years?
The original definition didn't include minorities, only women.

* What effects does the "Glass Ceiling" have?
There are not nearly enough women in higher positions than men.

* What has been done to combat the "Glass Ceiling"?
Women get higher education nowadays, and there is a law that should bring more women into higher working positions by averaging men and women in higher positions. Laws about anti-discriminations, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Opportunity Laws.

* Compare the phenomenon of "Glass Ceiling" in the US (a developed country), with that in developing countries
In developing countries, the "Glass Ceiling" is still a big barrier for women and minorities. There have been no actions taken to fight that problem. There is also the problem with education of women and minorities, and there are often religious rules that forbid women getting into "better" jobs. (I.e. I think it's Iran, where women hadn't been allowed to drive a car until just recently, but still aren't allowed to go to the university).

===== Glass Ceiling =====

1. Article and comprehens questions
The term Glass Ceiling means that specifis groups of people cannot reach higher positions. These peoples most woman or people, who came out from minorities.
The effects are that women don't feel worth enough to fill out higher positions. Also don't earn the same salary, with a comparable education, as there male colleguaes. They don't feel exept by there bosses.
The US goverment made laws, which should forbid sexual discrimination and create more gender equality, but it still exist a giant gap between women and men.
In the beginning it was only for women, now are also minorities included.
In developing countries they cannot get a job, in our country they cannot get a higher position
